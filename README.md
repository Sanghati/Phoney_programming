A standard telephone has both numbers and letters on its keys. Each of the ten number keys has the letters associated as follows:

1,0: Have no corresponding letters
2:   A B C
3:   D E F
4:   G H I
5:   J K L
6:   M N O
7:   P R S
8:   T U V
9:   W X Y

Given a phone number, display all the permutations formed from the letters represented by the corresponding numbers of the last four digits of the phone number. The digits and should not be replaced.

The Input: The phone number starts in column one and will be in the form ``ddd-dddd''. The phone number is contained on one line.

The Output: The program should print the total number of permutations, followed by the permutations (one permutation per line). Order within a data set is not important.

Sample Input:

422-0990

Sample Output:

Total number of permutations = 9
